1) Trigger the event by clicking the mouse at a position inside the viewport

2) When the event is triggered, a golden statue of Danny Devito rises slowly out of the ground.
The statue is so large that it causes quakes at nearby obstabcles destroying them.

3) Nearby miners are transformed into Monks that worship the shrine. 
These monks path to the base of the nearest Danny Devito and throw themselves at his feet killing themselves.

4) The new entity is a turtle. It seeks warmth, and goes to find the nearest blacksmith. 
But the turtle is scared of miners. If a miner is nearby he will go into his shell and hide. 
If a turtle spots an oreblob, he becomes much faster and goes to eat the oreblob.
